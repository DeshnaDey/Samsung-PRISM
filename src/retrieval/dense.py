"""Dense bi-encoder retrieval over the FAISS index.  (owner: retrieval)

Encodes the query with the same checkpoint used for the corpus and takes the
nearest neighbours by inner product (== cosine, given normalized vectors).

This is the semantic half of the hybrid: it matches "sort a list without
built-ins" to a bubble-sort implementation that shares no tokens with the
query. It is also the half that misses exact identifier matches, which is what
BM25 is there to cover.

    ----------------
    1. Prepend ``config.QUERY_PROMPT_PREFIX`` if the checkpoint needs it.
       E5/BGE/GTE-family models lose a lot of accuracy without their prefix,
       and fail silently - nothing errors, the numbers are just worse.
    2. Encode ``query.text`` with the SAME model instance that built the index.
       A different checkpoint here produces vectors in an unrelated space and
       returns confident nonsense.
    3. L2-normalize if ``config.NORMALIZE_EMBEDDINGS``.
    4. ``scores, positions = index.search(query_vec, top_k)``
    5. Map positions back through ``index_builder.ids`` and return
       ``[(corpus_id, float(score)), ...]`` sorted descending.

    Watch out
    ---------
    FAISS returns ``-1`` for padding positions when the index holds fewer than
    ``top_k`` vectors. Filter those out or you will emit ``ids[-1]``, which is
    a real id and a wrong answer.
